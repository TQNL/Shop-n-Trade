# Shop-n-Trade
Introducing "Shop 'n Trade" - Revolutionize your gameplay with the ultimate trading enhancement data pack. Immerse yourself in a dynamic trading experience that brings unprecedented convenience and security to your Minecraft world.

Players can create a shop by placing a sign on a (double) chest, barrel or shulker box and then doing /trigger make_shop_here to convert the structure into a shop. Players can right-click the sign to buy, and if the item sold has additional nbt data (like enchantments or items in a shulker box), a confirmation message will appear in chat with that information.

Sign Format:
- Shopkeeper's Name
- Quantity Available
- Item ID (Accessible via f3+H)
- Price in Diamonds*

*a number, followed by a space, followed by any spelling or shortening of the word 'diamonds'.

See gallery images for examples.

If a shop is empty, the player and the shop keep will get alerted, even when the shop keep is currently offline. The coordinates and specifications of the empty shop are also gives.

Shopkeepers are equipped with the power to effortlessly collect profits at any moment through the "/trigger collect_shop_profits" command. Additionally, assistance is just a command away with "/trigger shop_help".

Shops are protected against griefing, by putting players into adventure mode when near them. To avoid getting trapped by this feature, you can do /trigger trapped_in_shop

planned features:
- support for items going past the character limit on a line of a sign
- the ability to buy with the shops
- a trading interface for direct player to player trading
